# Fine-Tuning-LLM-
This repository contains code to fine tune LLM's like GPT2, GPT-Neo, Bloom and Llama for question answering task on medical dataset.
Used Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT) method namely Low Rank Adaptation (LoRa) to fine tune these big model in less time and using basic GPU (T4 GPU provided freely by Google Colab).
Used bitsandbytes module to load these big models in 4 bit configuration.
